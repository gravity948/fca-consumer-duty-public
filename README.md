# fca-consumer-duty-public

## Project Aim & Motivation
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has released a new consumer duty which further reinforces requirements on financial services firms to look out for the best interests of their retail customers. Part of this is to not bury key information in complex terms and conditions (T&Cs) that customers will not read. The aim of this project is to establish how effectively firms are currently meeting this aspect of consumer duty. 

## Project Methodology 
We focused on establishing the readability and legibility of terms and conditions of financial services firms from 5 industries that are regulated by the FCA. Our methodology can be roughly divided into 6 stages: 
1. Defining scope of companies and T&Cs
2. Getting links to the T&Cs 
3. Extracting textual and formatting features from T&Cs through web scraping
4. Constructing Readability measures
5. Constructing Legibility measures
6. Results & Overall Metrics
